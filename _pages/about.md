I am a Research Fellow at [Wadhwani AI](http://wadhwaniai.org){:target="\_blank"}, a unique organisation with the mission of AI for Social Good: To leverage AI to help the next 5 billion people. Prior to that, I completed my undergrad in Mathematics at [IIT Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in). At the core of my research curiosity is 3D computer vision, machine learning and Bayesian modelling.

In the past, I have been a research intern at [Adobe](https://research.adobe.com/), India where I worked on privacy and bias in ML models. I have worked on vareity of mini-projects on topics ranging from Bayesian inference to understanding rotations in 3D.
