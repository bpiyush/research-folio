Hi! I am a Research Fellow at [Wadhwani AI](http://wadhwaniai.org){:target="\_blank"}, a unique organisation with the mission of AI for Social Good: to leverage AI to help the next 5 billion people. Specifically, I have been primarily working on [estimating infant anthropometry from monocular video](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/work/maternal-newborn-child-health/). Since the advent of the pandemic, I have also been working on the [Cough Against COVID](https://coughagainstcovid.org/) initiative.

Prior to that, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics at [IIT Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in) where I enjoyed my coursework, especially courses on probabilistic modelling taught by [Dr. Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/). At the core of my research curiosity is 3D computer vision, probablistic modelling and inference.

In the past, I have been a research intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) where I worked on privacy and bias in ML models. I have worked on variety of mini-projects on topics ranging from Bayesian optimization, zero-shot learning and understanding rotations in 3D.
